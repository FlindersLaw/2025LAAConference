In response to this challenge, this paper proposes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into legal education through the development of a specialised chat bot tailored to enhance students' practical legal skills."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Initially focussing on negotiation skills (before expanding to other skills such as client interviewing and advocacy), this innovative approach aims to provide students with a convenient and accessible platform for practicing and enhancing their negotiation skills in a simulated environment. By enabling students to upload facts and designate roles within a negotiation scenario, the chat bot will facilitate realistic and personalised practice negotiations.  Through interactive dialogue, students will engage with the chat bot to create an agenda and negotiate key issues, allowing students to practice using different negotiation skills.  The chat bot will also offer feedback to students after each session, focusing on the specific skills and competencies to be assessed."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"By leveraging AI capabilities, such as natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, the chat bot can provide nuanced feedback tailored to the student\u2019s individual performance, thus encouraging their continuous improvement.
