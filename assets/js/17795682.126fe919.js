This national\ninitiative responds to the call from the Chairs and Panel Members of the Australian Legal\nEducation Awards (ALEAs) to utilise peer review as a measure of teaching effectiveness in\nALEA nominations, as well as the ongoing concerns with over-emphasising student evaluations\nof teaching. Importantly, the LEAD PRoT Program fills an equity and access gap for those law\nacademics at Australian law schools, faculties and institutions that do not offer opportunities to\nengage in peer review. The LEAD PRoT program is aligned with the Australian Universities\nAccord: Final Report\u2019s recommendations to systematically use peer review to improve teaching\npractice and introduce an accreditation system at a national level. Consistent with these\nrecommendations, LEAD accredits LEAD Peer Reviewers based on participation in professional\ndevelopment such as the LEAD PRoT Community of Practice. The potential benefits for LEAD\nPeer Reviewers include empowering other law academics by sharing their knowledge and\nfeedback, strengthening their connections and collaborations with the national legal education\ncommunity and growing their leadership skills. On the other hand, LEAD Peer Reviewees are\nprovided with evidence to improve their learning and teaching practices, and support\napplications and/or nominations for probation, promotion, awards and fellowships. Eleven\nAustralian law schools (Canberra, Curtin, Griffith, MLS, QUT, UNE, UniSC, UniSQ, USyd,\nUWA and WSU) that are members of the Council of Australian Law Deans (CALD) expressed\ninterest in participating in the LEAD PRoT pilot. In this conference presentation, the Co-\nConvenors for LEAD reflect on the pilot of the LEAD Peer Review of Teaching Program,\nincluding the matching process, and present the learnings using a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses,\nopportunities, threats) analysis."})]})}function p(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
