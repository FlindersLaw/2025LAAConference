Despite the enthusiasm, the development of\nthis transformative technology is dominated by STEM disciplines, which means many\nacademics in HASS-related disciplines can only consider the promises and perils of AI in\nhighly abstract terms. This gap is exacerbated by the proprietary nature of corporate-\ndeveloped chatbots, which often lack transparency and raise concerns about data privacy and\nalignment with pedagogical values. This study addresses these concerns by presenting\n'SmartTest', an AI chatbot that is designed by HASS academics. SmartTest prompts learners\nwith open-ended questions, offers immediate feedback, and employs conversational nudges\nto stimulate the reevaluation of incorrect answers. In Spring 2023, SmartTest was piloted in\nCriminal Law and Procedure B at the School of Law, University of Wollongong, over a five-\nweek period.

The survey results revealed a general appreciation for\nSmartTest's role in guiding students toward correct answers, as well as a decrease in anxiety\nlevels when compared to interactions with human instructors.
