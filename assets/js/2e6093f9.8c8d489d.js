Through a series of case studies, this\npresentation examines potential payoffs and pitfalls of using AI in the automation of routine legal tasks and\nregulatory compliance. A competence-based approach to AI-use must balance technological proficiency with\nessential lawyering skills such as critical thinking and sound ethical judgment.
