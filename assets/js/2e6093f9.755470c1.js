Through a series of case studies, this\npresentation examines potential payoffs and pitfalls of using AI in the automation of routine legal tasks and\nregulatory compliance. A competence-based approach to AI-use must balance technological proficiency with\nessential lawyering skills such as critical thinking and sound ethical judgment. As new AI-enabled decision\nsupport systems emerge, the legal profession, courts, government and legislature must co-design new\nstandards for AI applications to ensure fidelity to fairness and justice. To prepare and support lawyers to\nsucceed in \u2018smart workplaces\u2019, enhanced AI-literacy must be embedded into legal curricula and continuing\nlegal education programs.
