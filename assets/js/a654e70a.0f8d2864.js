This paper\npresents a detailed overview of the University of Western Australia (UWA) Law School's\ninitiative to incorporate international legal systems exposure through a structured short-term\nstudy tour in Singapore. The study tour, designed as an intensive summer law elective, sought\nto blend theoretical knowledge with practical legal insights, facilitating Juris Doctor students\nat UWA to earn credit units while gaining substantial international exposure. The five-day\ntour (December 4-7, 2023) involved interactive seminars led by a mix of academics and\npracticing legal professionals on selected areas of topical interest. Each session was designed\nto provide insights into the practical application and nuances of Singaporean law, contrasting\nwith Australian legal principles and practices. This outlines the educational strategy and\nobjectives behind UWA\u2019s short-term study tour and sets forth a detailed framework that other\nacademics might follow in developing similar programs."})]})}function p(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}}}]);
