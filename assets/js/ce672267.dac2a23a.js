While AI tools have promising implications for the future of many other professions (like administration roles), the role of AI within the legal profession is not yet settled.  More concerning is law students are using AI with impunity because most universities fail to have the appropriate detection software.

A traditional legal education hones not only mastery in critical thinking but also writing performance; by its very nature, this is not a passive learning experience.  It is still unclear whether a student can earn a law degree by using AI. However, the use of AI by legal practitioners has already forced the legal profession to acknowledge the potential risks of using AI in the courts."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
