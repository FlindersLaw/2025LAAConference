In this paper, we focus on three research questions. First, why is cross-cultural competence training important for Australian legal education and what kind of cross-cultural competence skills should Australian law students develop? Second, how do overseas countries promote cross-cultural competency in their legal education? In particular, how do law schools in these countries reform their curricula and adopt new strategies to promote cross-cultural competency? Third, what options and strategies can Australian law schools learn from their overseas counterparts to develop cross-cultural competence training? Finally, we argue that cross-cultural competence training can contribute to the growth of international legal practice in Australian legal profession and enhance equity, diversity and inclusion in Australian society."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
