This is not only a fundamental inquiry in the discipline of ethnology, but also one of\nthe issues decided in Judgment No 17 of 2022 by the Taiwan Constitutional Court. The\nJudgment is a recent demonstration of what insights ethnology can, or attempts to, bring into\nthe discipline of law. Inevitably, the two disciplines have different answers to the question,\nand several observations can be made. First, on the one hand, a legal \u2018test\u2019 for the recognition\nof indigenous ethnic group could adopt criteria or considerations that are not ethnological, eg\nlegislative intent or doctrines of transitional justice. Secondly, on the other hand, the legal test\nmay still refer to, at least partially, the ethnological understandings of the concept of ethnic\ngroup. In Judgment No 17, such understandings were perceived by the court through expert\nopinion. Thirdly, the legal test would nonetheless not escape criticism from the ethnology\ndiscipline, which raises the further question of to what extent should the legal understandings\ndepart from the ethnological understandings. Particularly, the legal test formed in Judgment\nNo 17 is criticised from the ethnological perspective for its overemphasis on bloodlines,\nvagueness and lack of nuance, and its inability to facilitate the development of a \u2018functional\u2019\nethnic group. In general, the effort to establish interdisciplinary relations of law and\nethnology on the issue of indigenous ethnic group recognition is welcomed. However, it\nremains unknown as to whether the dialogue between the two disciplines could reach any\nconclusion other than \u2018agreeing to disagree\u2019."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},6114:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{y:()=>o});t(6540);var i=t(6696),r=t(9321),a=t(8759),s=t(4848);function o(e){let{sKey:n,children:t}=e;return(0,s.jsxs)(s.Fragment,{children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{children:i.FD[n].title}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:a.A.csContainer,children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:a.A.csSessionNormal,children:t}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:a.A.csLearnButton,children:(0,s.jsx)(r.Px,{learnURL:i.FD[n].learnURL})})]})]})}},6696:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{FD:()=>a,q_:()=>i,xm:()=>r});const i=["A","B","C"],r="idNoSession",a={idNoSession:{title:"No session programmed",presenters:"",noAbstract:!0,learnURL:""},id1_A1:{title:"Automating Empirical Legal Research: the Case of British and Australian Judgments",presenters:"Ben Chen",learnURL:""},id1_A2:{title:"Enhancing Negotiation Skills in Legal Education: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence through a Chat Bot Approach",presenters:"Dr Tammy Johnson",learnURL:""},id1_A3:{title:"Building GenAI into Law Assessments: How do students use genAI when given the chance?",presenters:"Samantha Kontra, Senior Lecturer, Flinders University",learnURL:""},id1_A4:{title:"Magic Defeat Magic?
