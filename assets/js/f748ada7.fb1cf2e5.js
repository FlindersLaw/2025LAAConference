This conference paper reviews an interdisciplinary collaboration between academics in\nlaw, criminology, psychology, counselling and social work to produce an in-depth understanding\nof how and why assaults occur on Australian police officers in the execution of duty. Each\ndiscipline brought its own perspective, methodology and insights to capture the complexities of\nthe issue more comprehensively than a single field could alone. The law discipline enabled the\nskills to search cases in Westlaw, and interpret court cases and legislation, as well as an\nunderstanding of the classification of crime, seriousness of harms, culpability, sentencing\npurposes, sentencing options and appeals. Further, an appreciation of the difference between\ncriminal and civil cases was important to the inclusion and exclusion rules. The other disciplines\nbrought a more nuanced understanding of the offender such as their demeanour at the time of the\nincident, substance use, mental wellbeing, triggers and loss aversion theory. The project team\ndeveloped and applied a detailed codebook to Australian cases where police officers were\nassaulted in 2010 until 2023, resulting in a large dataset. The interdisciplinary analysis of the\nlarge dataset is intended to enrich criminal laws and sentencing policy."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}}}]);
