Take the escalators up to Level 1 and approach one of our Ambassadors.  They will let you up to Level 14 where the conference is held.

### When should I arrive?
The [conference program](/docs) has each day's start time.  Flinders staff will be on site at least 30 minutes before the scheduled start time.

### Entering and Leaving
The Conference is held on Level 14 of our City Campus, which is not a public access area.

There will be Conference Ambassadors waiting in the Level 1 lift lobby.  Just approach one of the Ambassadors and they will assist you in getting up to Level 14.

You do not need any access to leave the Conference venue. Simply take a lift down to Level 1.
