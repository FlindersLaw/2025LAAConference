**Attorney-General**  
**Minister for Aboriginal Affairs**  
**Minister for Industrial Relations and Public Sector**

Kyam is the Leader of Government Business in the Legislative Council, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-General, and Minister for Industrial Relations and Public Sector.

He is a proud Aboriginal man who is honoured to serve as the Aboriginal Affairs Minister in both the Weatherill and Malinauskas Labor Governments guiding important reforms such as being the first State in Australia to commence Treaty negotiations with Aboriginal Nations and implementing a Stolen Generations reparations scheme.

Kyam is particularly passionate about ensuring that all South Australians are afforded the dignity that good, meaningful jobs provide, and that all South Australians can share in the opportunities and benefits this State offers.

A Graduate of Adelaide University, he holds degrees in Law and Economics and practiced as a lawyer with the Crown Solicitor’s Office before working in politics.

After growing up in country South Australia, mainly Mt Gambier, Kyam now lives in the southern suburbs of Adelaide with his wife Carmel, three boys, a cat, and a growing flock of chooks.

Kyam enjoys spending time in regional SA, cycling (slowly), mowing the lawn and has a particular fondness for a good sausage roll.
