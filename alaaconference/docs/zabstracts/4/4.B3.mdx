## Abstract
Susskind observes that despite substantial changes in the legal profession, particularly as a
result of the impact of technology, there will always be a role for “the expert trusted advisor”,
in other words, “intelligent, creative, innovative lawyers”<sup>1</sup> who can develop and communicate
“new solutions and strategies”.<sup>2</sup> Communication, group and higher order thinking skills
therefore assume particular importance in this rapidly changing environment. Assessable
class participation (ACP) is an important tool for educators to develop these core skills in
students, as it is well established that when assessed, class participation increases.<sup>3</sup>

At the Faculty of Law and Justice, UNSW, ACP underpins our approach to learning and
teaching. Through an inter-disciplinary research study, student perspectives around ACP
were examined through a survey across 2 nd and 3 rd year law students. This presentation will
outline the preliminary findings from a current sample of 122 student responses, including
factors that enable and inhibit class participation, student emotions associated with ACP and
the role of instructors in creating optimum environments for class participation. The
presentation will also describe outcomes from the comparison of survey responses between
subsets of the student cohort (e.g., student gender, international vs domestic students and
whether English is the primary language).The presentation will also discuss the implications
of the findings in terms of student engagement, learning and wellbeing.<sup>4</sup>
