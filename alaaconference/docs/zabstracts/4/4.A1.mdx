## Abstract
This is the opening quote of John Merryman in ‘Legal Education There and Here: A
Comparison’ the opening lines in John Merryman’s article published in 1975 - 27 *Stanford
Law Review* 859.

This paper reviews the changes which have taken place within the Australian Legal
Education Community during and since the publication in 2017 of the presenter’s book *‘A
History of Australian Legal Education’* - Federation Press. It traces the critical role which
legal education occupied in shaping the culture of law in 2017 and the changes which have
taken place since then. In particular the increased demands which the Covid Pandemic has
made on the teaching of law and how Australian law schools and the Ad Hoc Law
Associations have responded to these challenges. The paper will question whether there is
still a tension between the demands of ‘training’ and ‘educating’ which has previously given
rise to an on-going conflict in Australian legal education.
