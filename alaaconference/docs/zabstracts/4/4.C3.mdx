## Abstract
Aviation is one of the highest regulated forms of human activity. Many areas of law constitute
the aviation regulatory environment, encompassing public, private and international laws.

On 22 January 1980, Captain Deborah Lawrie AM (then Wardley) made history when she
flew as the co-pilot of an Ansett Airlines flight from Alice Springs to Darwin, making her
Australia’s first female pilot for a major airline. This event marked the culmination of a
protracted two-year battle through the courts all the way to the High Court of Australia, and
was the first successful sex discrimination case against an employer in Australia.

Although some four decades have transpired since the High Court of Australia decision in
*Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty. Ltd. v. Wardley* (1980) 142 CLR 237
(*“Wardley”*), and despite the pioneering efforts of Captain Lawrie, women continue to be
underrepresented in tertiary aviation courses and in the aviation sector generally. Airline
cabin crew staff have seen relatively better gender parity over the years than have their flight
crew colleagues in the cockpit.

The gender composition of the High Court of Australia at the time of Wardley was solely
male. For a brief period during 2022, there was a majority of female justices on the High
Court of Australia bench, including the Court’s first ever female Chief Justice. In 2020, the
first ever female CEO was appointed to Virgin Australia (the first since its formation in 2020
as Virgin Blue) and, in 2023, the first ever female CEO was appointed to Qantas (the first
since its formation in 1920).

Whilst having regulatory measures and legal processes today that prohibit discrimination on
the grounds of gender as had occurred in Wardley is unquestionably significant, attention
still needs to be had in the learning experiences and employment opportunities for female
aviation students and future aviation professionals.

Given the highly regulated nature of the aviation sector both domestically and internationally,
there are mutual legal scholarship opportunities and enhanced student outcomes for both
law and aviation students. This paper seeks to analyse these opportunities and outcomes in
addressing the issues affecting gender parity for aspiring female aviation professionals.
Furthermore, important and related issues of sustainability, internationalization in the
aviation sector and measures to address such issues in aviation law education and
scholarship will also be considered.
