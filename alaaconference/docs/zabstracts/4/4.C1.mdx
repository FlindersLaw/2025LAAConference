## Abstract
In an increasingly interconnected global legal landscape, practical exposure to different
judicial systems stands as a critical component of comprehensive legal education. This paper
presents a detailed overview of the University of Western Australia (UWA) Law School&#39;s
initiative to incorporate international legal systems exposure through a structured short-term
study tour in Singapore. The study tour, designed as an intensive summer law elective, sought
to blend theoretical knowledge with practical legal insights, facilitating Juris Doctor students
at UWA to earn credit units while gaining substantial international exposure. The five-day
tour (December 4-7, 2023) involved interactive seminars led by a mix of academics and
practicing legal professionals on selected areas of topical interest. Each session was designed
to provide insights into the practical application and nuances of Singaporean law, contrasting
with Australian legal principles and practices. This outlines the educational strategy and
objectives behind UWA’s short-term study tour and sets forth a detailed framework that other
academics might follow in developing similar programs.
