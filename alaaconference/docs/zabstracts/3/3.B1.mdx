## Abstract
Gen Z legal professionals, those born 1995-2009, are encountering a complex and rapidly changing
world of work. Both personal and professional relationships and communications are increasingly
digitally mediated. Online platforms shape knowledge construction and distribute the management
of trust[1]. Technological tools are changing both what lawyers do and how they do it. The promise of
automation comes with threats of job insecurity and challenges for skill development. Profound
cultural shifts are underway.

In this context of rapid and constant change, highly developed ‘human-centred’ professional skills
are more vital than ever. Coincidentally though, employers and educators anecdotally report
increasing numbers of graduates and students who seem to lack confidence interacting with others
in-person and apparently have greater difficulty than pre-pandemic cohorts in responding resiliently
to feedback.

What does this mean for the formation of Gen Z’s professional identity, and how they develop and
act on professional and ethical responsibilities? How does this impact their development of those
vital interpersonal skills, both with their work colleagues, their opponents, and their clients?

What does this mean for those who work with and teach Gen Z emerging and future lawyers? What
challenges need to be addressed in this ‘cross-cultural’ teaching and learning context? What new
skills might educators and supervisors require to navigate this increasingly diverse landscape? What
can the law and legal education learn from how other sectors and disciplines are responding?

Understanding this cultural/generational shift raises important and pressing questions for educators
and employers as to the extent that Gen Z lawyers should be expected to assimilate (or not) into
existing legal culture or whether they can (or should) be assisted to forge a new cultural and
professional paradigm.
