## Abstract
The legal profession and academy no longer stands at a technological crossroads. Having passed into the
‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’, it is clear that open access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving rapid
technological innovation in both legal practice and legal education. Through a series of case studies, this
presentation examines potential payoffs and pitfalls of using AI in the automation of routine legal tasks and
regulatory compliance. A competence-based approach to AI-use must balance technological proficiency with
essential lawyering skills such as critical thinking and sound ethical judgment. As new AI-enabled decision
support systems emerge, the legal profession, courts, government and legislature must co-design new
standards for AI applications to ensure fidelity to fairness and justice. To prepare and support lawyers to
succeed in ‘smart workplaces’, enhanced AI-literacy must be embedded into legal curricula and continuing
legal education programs. The presentation concludes that the legal profession and academy, by engaging
with AI proactively, can lead the world—as it so often aspires to—in shaping a just legal system for the digital
age.
