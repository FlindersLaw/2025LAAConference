## Abstract
This panel-format session provides an opportunity to consider the opportunities and challenges presented to legal educators by generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI). The session is led by members of the LEAD (Legal Education Associate Deans) Network and is designed to facilitate an open-ended and inclusive conversation around four questions. First, how can Gen AI be used responsibly by legal educators to design and prepare learning activities and assessment tasks and provide feedback on student work? Second, how can teachers enable law students to learn how to use Gen AI in ways that are both ethical and relevant to their careers? Third, what role, if any, can legal practitioners play in the identification and articulation of Gen AI competencies that can be taught and assessed at law school? Fourth, how can institutional policies guide and support the use of Gen AI in unsupervised long-form written assessment in the disciplinary context of Law? Colleagues are invited to share their questions, insights, and experiences to ensure a rich and constructive conversation about Gen AI that takes us beyond the scope of integrity.
