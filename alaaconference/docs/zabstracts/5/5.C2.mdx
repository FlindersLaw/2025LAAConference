## Abstract
Courts are being used by citizen movements to challenge government inaction to achieve net zero as required under binding laws.  A key aspect to the argument is the impact on present and future generations of the  downstream effect of Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions refer to indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that occur due to an organizationâ€™s activities but are beyond its direct operational control.  These emissions encompass the entire life cycle of a product or service, including emissions from suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.

The paper will look at two cases Waratah coal from Queensland and the Finch case from the UK and extract a set of lessons reflecting the pervasive nature of climate change  and the net zero requirements embedded in Australian and UK law.

The paper will reflect on:
* Environmental impact statements; and
* Consideration  of present and future generations
