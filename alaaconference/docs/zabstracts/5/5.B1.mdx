## Abstract
When lawyers speak of social justice, we rarely consider that these issues extend to
ourselves, the practitioners, or the law students who will someday become practitioners. My paper
argues that law faculties wield enormous power and can shape the profession by shaping the culture
within law schools themselves, and rather than being passive suppliers of legal profession cannon
fodder, can encourage, indeed, drive change within the profession through engagement and outreach
with firms, professional associations and government bodies. By taking a stewardship approach to
their students and faculties rather than just providing spaces for networking, law schools can ensure
their former charges are being properly cared for by the sometimes savage system they&#39;re sent
into—armed with legal knowledge, but vastly under-prepared when it comes to the isolating,
emotionally gruelling and often disheartening cultures within the legal profession.

What is to be done?

There are many things law schools can do to create change—once they accept their own
agency—within the law school, outside of the law school, and as a mediator between the law school
and the legal profession.

To start with, law schools can prepare their students for reality—not just teach students to write letters
and briefs, but also about the sexism, the racism, lack of representation—and create alumni
programmes that provide safe harbour for students—counselling, access to legal advice (just because
lawyers practice law doesn’t mean they are equipped to deal with their own problems) and where
necessary, create outreach programmes with firms so that everyone in the profession is aware that
your alumni are not alone in the wilderness. This would mean law schools have to accept the culture
within the legal profession and be courageous enough to deal with it head on. There are plenty of
caring legal practices and practitioners—but these firms don’t always get a look in.
 
As law degrees nudge upwards of AUD150,000 (at post-grad level), the profession still fails to hold
onto talented practitioners—women especially are still leaving the law in droves—one might argue
there is a strong business case as well as a moral duty for faculties to go the extra mile to ensure the
wellbeing of their current and former students.
 
While the NSW Law Society and Office of the NSW Legal Services Commissioner (OLSC) are vocal
about stamping out sexual harassment and provide opportunities to report sexual harassment,
reporting is arguably for the more extreme cases. In my own experience as a criminal practitioner,
sexual harassment in the legal profession is embedded into the daily conversational experience—not
dissimilar to the experiences of women in the trades. Sexual comments, jokes—not just between men
and women, but between male practitioners and male practitioners is commonplace. The legal
profession is like a locker room—there is no escape. That&#39;s not to say things aren&#39;t changing—but
organisational change is slow, multi-dimensional and requires the tone to be set and enforced from
the top. The legal profession is large and multinodal—finding &quot;the top&quot;, that is reaching the leaders,
some of whom have themselves been responsible for misbehaviour—is not always easy for many
reasons—including law school self-interest. Some law schools will lag behind but intelligent law
faculties with leaders who understand the growing importance of governance and
sustainability—including the increasing emphasis placed on reputation—will appreciate both the moral
dimensions and financial edge of good governance at both the law school and industry level.

By creating supportive environments for all students, taking steps to actively reduce bullying and
exclusion, encouraging and providing support for traditionally marginalised groups (such as single
parents and people from under-represented backgrounds) in the study and practice of law are
avenues law faculties can embrace with a sense of purpose—but this requires practical assistance
and ongoing scrutiny rather than simply words and good intentions. Social justice for the legal
profession has got to start at home—and that means at the faculty level.
