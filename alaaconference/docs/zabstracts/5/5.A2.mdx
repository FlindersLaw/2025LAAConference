## Abstract
This panel-format session provides an overview of a major new open-
access legal education book entitled Becoming a Climate Conscious Lawyer:
Climate Change and the Australian Legal System (edited by Julia Dehm, Nicole
Graham, Zoe Nay, published by LTU eBureau). This online book is a grass-roots
response of legal educators around Australia to the growing demand for student
learning materials on the impact of climate change on the discipline and profession
of law, and how law is itself changing in response to a climate-changed world. Most
legal educators’ research expertise sits outside the field of &#39;climate law&#39;, and yet
climate change is increasingly relevant to all areas of the core legal curriculum, as
well as many electives, due to the innovative uses of existing legal concepts,
doctrines, and rules to promote climate mitigation and adaptation. The panel brings
together some editors and authors of the book to consider strategies for curricular
innovation which both satisfies the need for Priestley compliance and takes seriously
the plasticity of law as an agent for change. The panel will discuss how legal
educators can support the next generation of lawyers to practise as ‘climate
conscious’ legal professionals with the relevant expertise and competencies to
deliver legal services and promote climate justice to a wide range of clients in a
climate transformed world.
