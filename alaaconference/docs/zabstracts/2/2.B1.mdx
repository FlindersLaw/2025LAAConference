## Abstract
In 1970 Norval Morris and Gordon Hawkins published a book: The Honest Politicians Guide to Crime Control which set out what they believed (in a USA context) is working to reduce crime. They set our 43 “ukases” or decrees. My paper is a more modest attempt in the Australian context in the twenty first century. I set out 12 priorities, all of them based upon a social justice framework and my writings (in law and criminology) over the past 40 years. There is, I surmise, far more value in tackling the societal factors that allow crime to persist than applying a strict application of the criminal law and the justice system that feeds upon it. That system is necessary, yes, but not sufficient. In fact, it is very often counter-productive.
