## Abstract
Among the extensive academic and media coverage of the climate litigation
landscape, there is a perception that there is a lack of legal scholarship on topics of climate
litigation from authors from or based in the Global South. We sought to evaluate the veracity
of this assumption by conducting a literature review of academic work written by individuals
either hailing from or currently based in countries in the Global South. We found that there is
a wide body of work by these authors available in the field of climate litigation, on a range of
themes and across a wide breadth of geographies. This suggests that the work of these authors
is not given sufficient prominence in discussions on climate litigation, which is presents a
challenge to be addressed going forward.
