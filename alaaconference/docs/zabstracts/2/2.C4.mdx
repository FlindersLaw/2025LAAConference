## Abstract
What is to be recognised as an ethnic group (or as in the present case, an indigenous ethnic
group)? This is not only a fundamental inquiry in the discipline of ethnology, but also one of
the issues decided in Judgment No 17 of 2022 by the Taiwan Constitutional Court. The
Judgment is a recent demonstration of what insights ethnology can, or attempts to, bring into
the discipline of law. Inevitably, the two disciplines have different answers to the question,
and several observations can be made. First, on the one hand, a legal ‘test’ for the recognition
of indigenous ethnic group could adopt criteria or considerations that are not ethnological, eg
legislative intent or doctrines of transitional justice. Secondly, on the other hand, the legal test
may still refer to, at least partially, the ethnological understandings of the concept of ethnic
group. In Judgment No 17, such understandings were perceived by the court through expert
opinion. Thirdly, the legal test would nonetheless not escape criticism from the ethnology
discipline, which raises the further question of to what extent should the legal understandings
depart from the ethnological understandings. Particularly, the legal test formed in Judgment
No 17 is criticised from the ethnological perspective for its overemphasis on bloodlines,
vagueness and lack of nuance, and its inability to facilitate the development of a ‘functional’
ethnic group. In general, the effort to establish interdisciplinary relations of law and
ethnology on the issue of indigenous ethnic group recognition is welcomed. However, it
remains unknown as to whether the dialogue between the two disciplines could reach any
conclusion other than ‘agreeing to disagree’.
