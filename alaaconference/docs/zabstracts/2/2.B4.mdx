## Abstract
Family Law does not always get the attention it deserves. Branded an optional ‘elective’ topic, not always offered every year, grouped with special-interest courses like Sports Law. Nevertheless, almost every lawyer will encounter family law in practice, and will have friends or family members asking them to weigh in on a messy separation.

Along with obvious intersections with property, corporate, and constitutional law, and statutory interpretation, Family Law also offers unique insights into Australian contemporary society which are essential for any lawyer working with people. Through lenses of child rights and welfare, family violence, dispute resolution and structural and gendered inequality, Family Law opens students’ eyes to the abilities and limitations of laws and legal processes to promote social justice and address community need.

Drawing on available literature, this presentation makes an argument for Family Law as the provider of an essential knowledge base and set of skills for graduates who can understand the needs and perspectives of clients in any area of law. It makes a case for the proper resourcing of this essential course, including the need for Family Law to be taught by experts.
