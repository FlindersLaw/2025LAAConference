## Abstract
There is a dearth of literature on the assaults on Australian police officers in the execution of
duty. This conference paper reviews an interdisciplinary collaboration between academics in
law, criminology, psychology, counselling and social work to produce an in-depth understanding
of how and why assaults occur on Australian police officers in the execution of duty. Each
discipline brought its own perspective, methodology and insights to capture the complexities of
the issue more comprehensively than a single field could alone. The law discipline enabled the
skills to search cases in Westlaw, and interpret court cases and legislation, as well as an
understanding of the classification of crime, seriousness of harms, culpability, sentencing
purposes, sentencing options and appeals. Further, an appreciation of the difference between
criminal and civil cases was important to the inclusion and exclusion rules. The other disciplines
brought a more nuanced understanding of the offender such as their demeanour at the time of the
incident, substance use, mental wellbeing, triggers and loss aversion theory. The project team
developed and applied a detailed codebook to Australian cases where police officers were
assaulted in 2010 until 2023, resulting in a large dataset. The interdisciplinary analysis of the
large dataset is intended to enrich criminal laws and sentencing policy.
