## Abstract
The adoption and advancement of digital technology in various aspects of
society has created an immeasurable influence and radical transformation in
society. The transformation scope in the legal studies, law profession and the
justice system ranges from establishment of new concepts and areas of
practice such as law of block-chain, digital evidence, new forms of properties,
digital privacy and data protection, cybercrimes and new models of
commercial transactions among others. These developments are complex
and dynamic in nature and more of interactive activities but with a foundation
in the contemporary laws. Today, digital technology has created a new
generation of digital lawyers equipped with advanced skillful use of digital
technology in a wide range such as virtual hearings, enhanced research and
writing through artificial intelligence (AI), processing the admissibility of
electronic evidence among others. Therefore, digital technology has
influenced the legal profession by advancing the character and practice of law
hence creating a dawn of new business models for lawyers whose strength is
determined by the availability of digital infrastructure. These business models
differ from the conventional modes of practicing law such as litigation,
conveyancing and consultancy to new models such as content creators of
law, digital solutions for law professionals, digital advocacy and subscription
services. However, the influence of digital technology in law practice on
adoption and propagation of new business model is far from being a reality for
lawyers in Kenya due to various barring and limiting factors. This paper will
asses and analyse various factors that limit progressive practice of law in Kenya under
the umbrella of new business models enabled by digital technology in the light
of legal and ethical perspectives in Kenya.
