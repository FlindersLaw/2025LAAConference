## Abstract
Technology has had an outsize impact on the legal profession, fundamentally transforming legal
research, legal practice and, to a lesser degree, the provision of legal services. We are now on the
cusp of potentially another fundamental paradigm shift as generative AI systems continue to
mature. Consequently, it is increasingly crucial that law students and professionals understand legal
technology, its potential and its challenges.

At Flinders University, our approach has been to expose students to fundamental technology
concepts. These concepts include an understanding of decision-making logic, the nature of data and
its storage and manipulation. We do this by teaching students how to express legal issues as
software applications.

We started on our journey in 2019 using a proprietary technology platform and focussed on building
simple legal applications for not-for-profit organisations (NFPs). However, accessibility and
affordability issues led us to shift in 2020 to an open source platform. This shift required creating
teaching materials from scratch. This shift also facilitated interdisciplinary collaborations with
Computer Science staff and students, and with colleagues from Nursing and Health Sciences. Since
these topics commenced our students have created approximately 70 legal software applications for
over 40 NFPs in our state, across Australia and even internationally. Skills developed by students
have opened new opportunities and employment pathways locally, nationally and internationally.

Despite this success, and despite continued encouragement from the profession, students find it
hard to see how what they are learning connects with the law and with what lawyers do.

This presentation will report on our experiences over the past 5 years in developing this innovative
curriculum, including a self-published online textbook. This presentation will also explore how we
are responding to feedback from students and NFP clients, as well as accelerating technological
change.
