## Abstract
Comparing a Marvel blockbuster movie script to language used within Law Schools is not
the norm. However, in a rapidly changing world, terminology, such as Artificial Intelligence,
Large Language Models, Chatbot and adaptative algorithm, have been unleashed upon the
legal fraternity, leading one to ask; Will technology replace the ability of law students to
think for themselves or indeed will Iron Man appear, destroy the threats that AI presents,
saving future generations of law students from the scourge of AI?

This paper will explore the role that AI has in legal education from a student’s perspective.
These perspectives and reflections will be drawn from data obtained by way of student
surveys, conducted within three Law Schools*. Student responses to questions such as -
What do you think AI is? What role should AI have in legal education? Do you think using AI
is cheating? Why would you use AI? Is AI within legal education, a Superhero or Villain? –
will be analysed, with institutional similarities and differences considered.
It is important to remember that not long ago, the use of Learning Management Systems
revolutionised legal education. Villain or Superhero? Does embracing technology signal the
death knell for academics? Or is there a silver lining where the academic remains the
Superhero keeping the Villain, AI, in check?

\* **Survey Sample**: 30 random students, 10 per university, Year 1-4, from three Law
Schools: Victoria University, Australian Catholic University and Deakin University,
Melbourne.
