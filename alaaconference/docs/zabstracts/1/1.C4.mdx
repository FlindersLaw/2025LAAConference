## Abstract
While the law continues to be a technology of dispossession for Indigenous Peoples, Indigenous
communities are fighting back, using indigenous law to bring new challenges to injustices.

In *Michael Smith v Fonterra Cooperative Group Limited* [2024] NZSC 5 the Supreme Court held that
Mike Smith is entitled to pursue his tikanga Māori tortious claims against seven of New Zealand’s
major greenhouse gas emitters. Smith claims that as a result of the defendants failure to reduce their
emissions, despite their ability to make reductions, they cause and will cause harm to his, his
whānau’s and his descendants whakapapa (genealogical connection) and whanaungatanga (exercise of
responsibilities) to their land, waters, food sources and atmosphere.

He is making a tikanga Māori legal argument that tikanga Māori imposes obligations of kaitiakitanga
(guardianship) on him and his people to make the claim. The defendants greenhouse gas emissions
breach tikanga and causes harm that demands mitigation. He relies on the tort of public nuisance,
seeking a declaration that the defendants have caused or contributed to a public nuisance through their
emitting activities and an injunction on the defendants’ activities to reduce their emissions.

This is a significant new development in tikanga Māori law, climate change law and tort law in
Aotearoa New Zealand.  Our presentation will consider how tikanga Māori legal principles are
expressed, debated and developed within tikanga Māori claims concerning climate change. We will
describe how tikanga Māori is being used for innovations in tort law on kaitiakitanga matters as well
as in the development of the common law in other areas. This presentation will assist with informing
theory and application of bijuralism, bicultural and bilingual expressions in Aotearoa New Zealand
courts and the legal education system, which will impact how legal academics and law schools will
ensure that law students have the knowledge and skills they need to support innovative Indigenous
legal challenges.

This research is funded by a grant from Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga, New Zealand&#39;s Māori Centre of
Research Excellence.
