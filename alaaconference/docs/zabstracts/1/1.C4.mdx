## Abstract
There are a number of international treaties that deal with environmental false claims
and in particular in Europe for the generic concept of “greenwash”. Unfortunately,
very few regulators and environmental protection agencies (and similar bodies) have
had much success in enforcing internal laws. However, in respect of state laws there
has been some limited successes. The growth in class actions and opportunity for
consumers as “citizen scientists” has created opportunities for greedy corporations to
be held to account for false and misleading practising, involving claims of
environmental or climate changing practices. In the corporate world, as investors rely
more on environmental, sustainability and governance (ESG) reports, the
shareholder activism and consumer rights are being enforced from VW pollution
claims to Mercer’s Sustainable Superannuation fund (investing in fossil fuel). This
paper will unpack the various routes and opportunities for the private enforcement of
public international laws and its likely success.
