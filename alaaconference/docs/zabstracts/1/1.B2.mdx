## Abstract
Truth-telling and taking responsibility are integral parts of the University of Sydney’s
commitment to promoting equality and diversity by uncovering complicity with and
engagement in racist ideas and practices. One of the ways that Sydney Law School
is supporting and facilitating truth-telling is by listening to, learning from and
respecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledges and voices about the
legal system – how the legal system was established, what it has been, what it is
now and the avenues for change – and taking responsibility for the system that we
work within. This paper explores collegiate engagements across and beyond the
Law School that enrich the curriculum with the aim that all law graduates will listen,
hear and think about &#39;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ knowledges and
perspectives, including the ongoing effects of colonisation, and ... the cultural
specificity of law&#39;. This includes collaborative discussions and processes reflecting
on the cultural appropriateness of naming the new course learning outcome ‘Ngara’,
a Gadi word from the language of the Sydney basin which means ‘listen, hear, think’
(Troy, The Sydney Language (1994) p 74).
