## Abstract
Generative artificial intelligence (‘genAI’), such as ChatGPT,<sup>1</sup> has taken the world by storm. It has
also placed added stress on academics in higher education as we grapple with creating genAI-proof,
authentic assessment items. While some legal academics have embraced genAI, others have tried to
ignore it,<sup>2</sup> and some have tested its boundaries leading to conclusions that ChatGPT can produce
passable answers in some law topics,<sup>3</sup> and can draft legal documents, though it is challenged by legal
reasoning.<sup>4</sup> Students, too, use genAI for a multitude of purposes, both internal and external to their
law studies, sometimes leading to excellent learning opportunities.<sup>5</sup>

This presentation explores the incorporation of genAI in classroom teaching and assessment in an
undergraduate law program in 2023. It identifies the ways in which first year students in a
foundational law topic purport to use ChatGPT, and reports on the ways in which they actually use
ChatGPT during in-class formative exercises as well as in summative assessments. This is contrasted
with penultimate and final year students’ use of genAI (ranging from ChatGPT to Amica<sup>6</sup>) in two
authentic practice-based assessment tasks in a Family Law elective topic, as reported during assessed
supervisor interviews. Ultimately, this research has found that first year students are more likely to use
genAI when permitted, but with a specific focus on planning and initial idea generation. Senior
students are much less likely to use genAI and have poor opinions of genAI use in a legal context.
The analysis of these responses has led to the development of a specific module in a first year
foundational law topic that introduces students to genAI and its uses and implications during law
school and in the legal profession.<sup>7</sup>

This presentation will include opportunities for interactive discussion and sharing of ideas about law
student use of genAI and creation of law assessment items in the genAI era.
