## Abstract
This paper reports on an innovative interdisciplinary and intercultural approach to legal
scholarship that brings together feminist legal history and linguistics through the combined
methodologies of oral history and discourse analysis.

The research draws on a corpus of over 50 whole-of-life oral histories of Australian women
lawyers recorded for the Trailblazing Women and the Law (TBWL) project, led by Professor
Kim Rubenstein.<sup>1</sup> The project was in part inspired by the late Professor Karen Knop’s focus
on the effects of gender and cultural diversity on public international law and her invitation
to grasp ‘what is actually happening in the … legal community, who the actors really are,
and what each does’, by examining how the unique life experience and identities of
individuals have shaped their engagement with and contributions to the development of
law.<sup>2</sup>

The overall goal of the TBWL project is to foreground and explode ‘the detrimental and well-
noted silence surrounding the first women of law in Australia … by combining a cross-
section of disciplinary questioning to build a national consciousness of women lawyers and
to enable critical research of their diverse experiences.’<sup>3</sup>

The methodology adopted in the studies discussed in this paper is novel in combining legal
analysis with discourse analysis of the participants’ narratives. This approach enriches legal
scholarship by offering in-depth insights into the individual and shared gendered
experiences of women lawyers, and into those aspects of their personal and professional
biography that most influenced and enabled their contributions to legal reform and active
citizenship on the local, national and/or international stage.

Unlike their traditional use in gender and legal analyses, oral histories in our research are
treated as texts to draw upon and to question. Discourse analysis involves repeated close
reading of the interview transcript with a focus, at the macro-level, on sections of the text of
most relevance to the aims of the TBWL project and to specific research questions; and at
the micro-level, on identification of recurring motifs in the narrative. At an even more fine-
grained level, we adopted a model of voice<sup>4</sup> to analyse salient patterns of each participant’s
language use that form characteristic features of her self-portrayal, then compared these
with the impressions generated by the participant’s acoustic voice through close listening to
the audio recording of the interview.

The research reported in this paper offers insights for legal culture – which has largely
continued to background women lawyers and their achievements – and for legal and
linguistic academic scholarship, but also for the education of future lawyers. To this end, the
TBWL data is also being used to develop curriculum materials that inform and promise to
inspire secondary school students. The paper concludes by proposing avenues for future
research based on comparative analysis of content and narrative styles across the TBWL
corpus and other, international corpora.

1. The Trailblazing Project began in 2010 in partnership with the National Library of Australia (NLA) and was expanded in 2012 under the auspices of an Australian Research Council (ARC) linkage grant (Project Number LP 120200367), with partners including the NLA, the National Foundation for Australian Women, the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia and Australian Women Lawyers. Fellow Chief Investigators were Gavan McCarthy and Helen Morgan, then from the University of Melbourne, whose expertise in social networks, cultural informatics, ePublication and women’s history archiving assisted in the mining of interviews and development of research outcomes in those areas. A further contributor was the project’s PhD student, now Dr Louise Baker. Kevin Bradley was a Partner Investigator from the National Library of Australia who contributed substantial oral history expertise. Our Researcher/Coordinator Dr Nikki Henningham, formerly at the University of Melbourne, also brought to the team great oral history expertise.
