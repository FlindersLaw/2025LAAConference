## Abstract
Generative AI technology is disrupting the world as we know it. A myriad of tools is
developing with incredible speed that will revolutionise service industry sectors, including
education and law. The advent of large language models (e.g. ChatGPT) sent shock waves
through the University sector in 2023. Of immediate concern for legal academics was
academic integrity of assessments: would generative AI tools undermine our ability to use
‘traditional’ types of assessment such as essay style or problem based written assignments?
Would ChatGPT or its ‘cousins’ write assignments for our students, meaning that they would
not learn relevant professional skills? Most universities scrambled to develop policies for
students on working with AI responsibly. Most course coordinators changed their assessment
schemes to ‘AI proof’ the integrity of assessment. However, after this initial ‘shock’, the
potential for generative AI to contribute positively to learning and teaching must be
considered.

While we must ensure responsible and ethical use of generative AI tools and prevent breaches
of academic integrity, we should also recognise the countless opportunities that generative AI
tools create as assistants in the learning and teaching space. Tools can assist academics with
many aspects of their work, for example, course design, content creation, teaching delivery,
assessment design, evaluation and feedback. This paper focusses on using generative AI tools
(ChatGPT4, Microsoft Copilot and others) in the assessment space. It reports on a case study
where I have used these tools for drafting multi-answer quiz questions and feedback. It also
explores ways for developing scenario-based assessment, providing formative feedback to
students during completion and assisting markers with providing summative feedback. While
celebrating these opportunities, the paper also reflects on challenges of using generative AI
tools, including data privacy, data sovereignty and intellectual property issues. Overall, the
paper argues that harnessing the power of generative AI for learning and teaching is very
valuable for academics and students, as long as tools are used ethically and appropriately.

This requires clear policies and a commitment to upskilling university staff and students in
the use of generative AI.
