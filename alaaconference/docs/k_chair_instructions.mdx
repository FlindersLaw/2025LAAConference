## Before the Concurrent Session
* Arrive at the breakout room for your session 10 minutes before your Concurrent Session (**CS**) is due to start
* Ensure PPTs are loaded for your CS:
  * All PPTs are in [**this share**](https://flinders.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/ALAAConference2024Organizingcommittee/Eq2iRYPYbhJGnTW0btvoGsoBxPnCi6zW4uLKamrTyOYkFg?e=hU1hbH).
  * Go to the Folder for your CS and Stream (eg: 'Concurrent Session 1 Stream A')
  * The PPTs should be there in presentation order.
  * Each PPT is named with the session number and the presenter's name eg: *1.C1 Dara Dimitrov*.
  * Double-click on presentation. That will launch PowerPoint (web version) or Canva (depending on what presenter has chosen).
* Launch the [**Conference QR Code Slide**](https://flinders.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/ALAAConference2024Organizingcommittee/Shared%20Documents/General/Presentation%20Materials/ALAA%20Conference%20QR%20Code.pptx?d=wb920aff23a8249d5a6b5ebe4334e608d&csf=1&web=1&e=kNuyEO).
* Keep the QR slide open in presentation mode.  This directs attendees to the program and also prevents the screen saver from kicking in and locking the screen.

:::caution
1. You may need to sign in with your FAN on the presentation laptop.  Signing in can take up to 5 minutes.
1. Once you have signed in open up a web browser and navigate to [**https://conference.alaa2024.au**](https://conference.alaa2024.au)
and then to **Program and Conference Material** --> **Instructions for Chairs**.

* Greet session speakers and check how to pronounce their names.
* Speakers should speak in the order listed on the program – please do not change order.
* Each speaker has 20 mins for the presentation and 5 mins for questions. **Do not allow speakers to go overtime**. 
:::note
Some Concurrent Sessions have vacant slots due to last-minute withdrawals by presenters.  If you are chairing one of these CS you may allow speakers more than 20 minutes provided the entire CS does not finish late.
:::
* Inform speakers that bios will not form part of Introduction. Speakers may bio themselves but that comes out of their 20 minute allocation.
* Inform speakers of time cards.

## Keeping Time
